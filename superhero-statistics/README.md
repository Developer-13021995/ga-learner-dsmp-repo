### Project Overview

 This project describes the dispersion of superheros data and correlation between few attributes of the dataset. Also describes, how important the descreptive statistics are in data analysis


### Learnings from the project

 Learnt various descriptive statistics which can be performed to draw conclusions on the dataset such as, skewness , spread, central tendency. 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Visualisation is the approach i took majorly for getting stats from the data. Used various plots such as pie, bar, box plot to draw intutions from the various attributes of data.


### Challenges faced

 Drawing intutions from the data was the major challenges i have faced through this dataset. I have overcome those by using the various Descreptive statistics and visualizing wach and every attribute and also finding relations between the multiple attributes such as (intelligence, combat) and various such relations.
